# Network-Traffic-Analyzer
This Python Application script helps us to capture the Network Traffic.
The Network Traffic gets saved in the form of PCAP file(Packet Captured file).
Then You can open that PCAP file in WireShark Tool(a network monitoring tool) for detecting Anomolies.
This can be used mainly in Command Line Interface because you cannot find the GUI of WireShark in CLI.
